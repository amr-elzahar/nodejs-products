# Products

This is a CRUD web application built using Node.js and Express framework, with MongoDB as a database (with a locally hosted server) and Mongoose middleware to perform database operations. The app uses EJS (Embedded JavaScript) as a templating engine to display data dynamically on the front-end. The application follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern to separate concerns and make the code more organized.

The application allows the user to perform basic CRUD operations on a collection of products, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting product details. Users can add a new product, view a list of all products, edit or delete individual products.

This application is useful for anyone looking to learn and practice CRUD operations in a real-life example using popular web development technologies.

# Usage

To run the application, first make sure you have MongoDB installed locally on your system. Then start the MongoDB server, and run:

```
npm install
```

to install all the dependencies needed. Finally, start the application using:

```
npm start
```
